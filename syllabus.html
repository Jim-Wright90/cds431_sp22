</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-structure-and-materials" class="section level1">
<h1>COURSE STRUCTURE AND MATERIALS</h1>
<p>This class meets two times per week for 1-hour, 20-minute sessions. There is not a required textbook for this class. All course materials can be found on the course Canvas site and course website, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus</li>

</div>
<div id="student-engagement-hours" class="section level1">
<h1>STUDENT ENGAGEMENT HOURS</h1>
<p>Under the UO policy, each undergraduate credit should reflect approximately thirty hours of student engagement including in- and out-of-class activities. Therefore, a 3-credit course should engage students for approximately 90 hours total (an average of 8-hours per week). This class meets for one hour and fifteen-minutes twice per week. The additional course engagement hours (5hrs 30min per week) may include readings, preparing for discussions, completing in-class activities, written assignments, completion of quizzes outside of class time, and optional observation activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-assignments" class="section level1">
<h1>COURSE ASSIGNMENTS</h1>
<p>Course assignments will be posted on Canvas and discussed during class. An * indicates that the assignment is required to pass the course. The following includes basic information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>*Terms and Definitions: Students will complete this document during class. Terms are indicated in purple in the PowerPoint. You must have at least 40 terms/definitions by the end of the term. You can print this form and handwrite the terms/definitions. Students will submit this document at the end of the term.</li>
<li>*Case Study - In-Class Activities: For the most part, students will complete these activities during class. You may print the document and handwrite answers during the class. Occasionally, you will be asked to finish activities outside of class. Students will submit this completed packet at the end of the term.</li>
<li>*Out-of-Class Assignments: These four assignments will be completed independently outside of class and should be typed into a document (assignments in Canvas).<br />
</li>
<li>*Group Participation Feedback: You will complete this form at midterm and end of term.</li>
<li>*Quizzes: There will be 16 quizzes posted on Canvas to be taken after class. Each quiz reflects content covered in class and will be open in Canvas from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm on the day of the class.<br />
</li>
<li>CDS 431 Observation Hour Log: An Observation Hours Log for CDS 431 will be made available for students to log their hours week 10 of the term. More information will be presented in class.</li>
<li>Other Observation Document (optional): If you complete virtual observations through the HEDCO Learning Commons, you may present documentation to me for signing. Only logs with complete documentation will be signed. If you complete observations outside of the UO, the certified SLP that you observed will sign your log. You are responsible for maintaining logs of observations completed outside of this class. If you decide to use Master Clinician Network (fee-based online service for observations), I can approve those observations through June 30, 2022.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="case-study-confidentiality" class="section level1">
<h1>CASE STUDY CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>
<p>The parents of the case study participant graciously gave their permission for video and paper records to be used for instructional purposes within the CDS department. Every effort should be taken to ensure the confidentiality of the case study participants. All students will sign a case study confidentiality agreement on the first day of class. Any breach of this agreement would be considered academic misconduct.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading-policy" class="section level1">
<h1>GRADING POLICY</h1>
<p>This is a Pass/No Pass course.</p>
<p>Students will be graded on the class attendance and completion of in-class activities and out-of-class assignments. In order to “pass” this course, students must:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Attend 18 of the 20 scheduled in-class sessions and complete corresponding in-class activities for the days then attend. It is the student’s responsibility to sign the attendance sheet</li>
<li>Complete all out-of-class assignments and receive a passing grade. If a student gets a “no-pass” on an assignment, they have one week to resubmit the assignment for a passing grade</li>

<div id="fluidity-attendance-participation" class="section level1">
<h1>FLUIDITY, ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION</h1>
<p>As the university community continues to adjust to teaching and learning in-person in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. I will be mindful of the many impacts the unfolding events related to COVID-19 may be having on you. During this unusual time, I encourage you to talk with me about what you are experiencing so we can work together to help you succeed in this course.</p>

<div id="uo-covid-19-regulations-prevention-for-in-person-class" class="section level1">
<h1>UO COVID-19 REGULATIONS &amp; PREVENTION FOR IN-PERSON CLASS</h1>
<p>See <a href="https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/covid-19-regulations">here</a> for more information</p>
<p>The University of Oregon (UO), in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, Oregon Health Authority, and Lane County Public Health requires faculty, staff, students, visitors, and vendors across all UO locations to use face coverings with in UO owned, leased, or controlled buildings. This includes classrooms. Please correctly wear a suitable face covering during class. Students unable to wear face coverings can work with the <a href="https://aec.uoregon.edu/">Accessible Education Center</a> to find a reasonable accommodation. Students refusing to wear a face covering will be asked to leave the class.</p>
<p>Face covering are not required for fully vaccinated instructors, providing there is 6 feet of distance to others and that all others in the class are masked. For full guidelines, which are subject to change, see the UO’s face covering regulations. Students should obtain wipes available outside of classrooms before they enter class and use them to wipe down the table and seat they will use.</p>
<p>Please conduct regular <a href="https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/#before-campus">symptom self-checks</a> and do not come to class if you are experiencing symptoms. I will work with you to make sure you can stay caught up with the class. Use this <a href="https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/sites/coronavirus1.uoregon.edu/files/2020-08/self-monitoring.pdf">self-check log</a> to track your symptoms.</p>

<div id="college-of-education-covid-pandemic-protocol" class="section level1">
<h1>COLLEGE OF EDUCATION COVID PANDEMIC PROTOCOL</h1>
<p>The College of Education will follow all guidelines established by the University of Oregon. Given the ever-evolving nature of the pandemic these guidelines are subject to change during the year. Please see this <a href="https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/covid-19-regulations">website</a> for the most up-to-date UO policies regarding COVID</p>

<div id="college-of-education-approach-to-absences-related-to-covid" class="section level1">
<h1>COLLEGE OF EDUCATION APPROACH TO ABSENCES RELATED TO COVID</h1>
<p>For Fall of 2021 and beyond the College of Education (COE) and the University of Oregon will be relying on high vaccination rates and safety protocols in each building to allow for a safe, in-person return. To this end the COE course offerings for Fall 2021 and beyond is a return to pre-COVID instructional expectations for instructors and students. This means that instructors will once again be providing instruction in person and students who are unable to attend class will be expected to navigate this with their instructor as a typical class absence.However, this year is unlikely to be “typical” and over the course of the quarter one or more of us may run into short or extended absences due to COVID related concerns such as the need to quarantine or care for a family member due to COVID. In order to proactively plan for these potential absences, the following plan will be in place:</p>
<p>All lectures will be recorded via Zoom and uploaded directly to the course Canvas site. If students need to be absent for 2 classes or less due to a COVID related quarantine or illness, please make sure to access the recorded lectures. You may set up an appointment to meet with me to also go over all material missed. If students need to be absent due to a COVID related quarantine or illness for 3 class sessions or more, please set up an appointment to meet with me to discuss an individualized plan. Depending on student need, assignment and exam timelines will be shifted accordingly.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility that I may be absent due to COVID related concerns such as exposure, quarantining, or caring for family. If needed, lectures will shift entirely online via Zoom. For in-person experiential experiences, I will make every attempt to identify another faculty member or doctoral student who can assist with the in-person component. Information about any of these changes will be posted on Canvas as well as emailed to the class list. In order to request an accommodation for COVID related concerns students are directed to follow the process through the Accessible Education Center (AEC) which is the campus unit that will evaluate student needs to assist with providing and authorizing the necessary support. While the AEC <a href="https://aec.uoregon.edu/make-appointment-aec">website</a> refers frequently to disabilities, the unit responds more generally to concerns that impact instruction including health concerns.</p>

<h1>COURSE, DEPARTMENT AND UNIVERSITY POLICIES</h1>
<div id="indigenous-recognition-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>INDIGENOUS RECOGNITION STATEMENT</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.</p>
</div>
<div id="cds-undergraduate-program-grading-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>CDS UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM GRADING POLICY</h2>
<p>The CDS major is a rigorous, pre-professional major, which leads to advanced study in speech-language pathology, audiology, and related fields. With that in mind, CDS faculty members work to ensure students gain the scientific, theoretical, and applied clinical knowledge to prepare them for future careers. Grades in the courses serve as one metric to allow graduate programs and employers to evaluate CDS graduates.</p>
<p>Grading in the CDS department reflects the following fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>A grade, whether a final grade or one for an individual assignment, is to be determined based on objective criteria applied equally for all students.</li>
<li>Grades are assigned for the work product submitted by the student. Faculty members are unable to evaluate or give credit for factors such as level of effort or time taken to complete an assignment.</li>
<li>Grades are based on work outlined in the course syllabus, which is available to all students. Individual extra credit assignments will not be considered or accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these principals, individual faculty members may choose assignments, grading criteria, and scales for calculation of final grades, which fit within the nature of content covered and individual philosophies.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding the assignment of final grades, the CDS faculty members agree student requests for grade changes after final grades have been posted will not granted unless an error has been made in calculating or inputting the final grade.</strong></p>
<p>This course is graded as Pass/No-Pass. Grading procedures are detailed in this syllabus. Please contact me immediately with any questions or concerns. For most of you, this is your last term before graduation and you need to earn a Pass. You are responsible for monitoring your progress in class and quickly identifying any problems or issues that might interfere with successful completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessible-education" class="section level2">
<h2>ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Please let me know within the first two weeks of the term if you need assistance to fully participate in the course. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based information, in-class activities, and quizzes. The <a href="https://aec.uoregon.edu/">Accessible Education Center</a> works with students to provide an instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and adjustments to class design that will enable better access. Contact the Accessible Education Center for assistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.</p>

<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students. To do so requires that we: * respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals. * promote a culture of respect throughout the University community. * respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others. * reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind. * practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others. * promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.</p>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.</p>

<div id="using-pronouns-and-personal-preference" class="section level2">
<h2>USING PRONOUNS AND PERSONAL PREFERENCE</h2>
<p>The College of Education is always working to include and engage everyone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words you want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names, pronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be respected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used with your professor to help them be aware of how to address you respectfully. Please visit this <a href="https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns">university website</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</h2>
<p>The University Student Conduct Code (available at conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at <a href="https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism" class="uri">https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism</a>.</p>

<div id="mental-health-and-welness" class="section level2">
<h2>MENTAL HEALTH AND WELNESS</h2>
<p>Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If you’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your own–there’s help and support on campus.</p>
<p>As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.</p>
<p>University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.</p>
<p>University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).</p>
